# Quicker Open README

Search your files through abbreviation

## Features

Similar to the familiar ctrl+p files opener, use ctrl+alt+p to open files with abbreviation search.\
Example: Searching `ftm` would suggest `FormulasTelemetryManager.ts`, `FunctionsThrottlingManager.js`, `forTheMoshe.js`.\
`ftm.js` will suggest the latter 2.

## Extension Settings

`quickeropen.includePath` - array of patterns to filter file paths to include.\
`quickeropen.excludePath` - array of patterns to filter file paths to exclude.
